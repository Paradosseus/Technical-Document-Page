                At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

                Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

            In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!

                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph  (< p >) element:</p>
            <code>< p >My cat is very grumpy< /p ></code>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy-of-an-HTML-element">
          <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
          <p>
            The anatomy of our element is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.  
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
              <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
              <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting-elements">
          <header>Nesting elements</header>
          <article>
              <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a < strong > element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
              <code>< p >My cat is < strong >very</ strong > grumpy.< /p ></code>
              <p>
                You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the < p > element first, then the < strong > element; therefore, we have to close the < strong > element first, then the < p >  element. The following is incorrect:
              </p>
              <code>< p >My cat is < strong >very grumpy.< /p >< /strong ></code>
              <p>
                The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!
              </p>

          <article>
            <p>
                Some elements have no content and are called <b>empty elements</b>. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:
            </p>
            <code>< img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" ></code>
            <p>
                This contains two attributes, but there is no closing < /img > tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.
            </p>

                That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):
            </p>
            <code>< !DOCTYPE html >
                    < html >
                    < head >
                        < meta charset="utf-8" >
                        < title>My test page< /title >
                    < /head >
                    < body >
                        < img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" >
                    < /body >
                    < /html >
            </code>
            <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>< !DOCTYPE html > — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                    <li>< html >< /html > — the < html > element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                    <li>< head >< /head > — the < head > element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li>
                    <li>< meta charset="utf-8" > — This element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>
                    <li>< title >< /title > — the < title > element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li>
                    <li>< body >< /body > — the < body > element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
                </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Images">
          <header>Images</header>
          <article>
            <p>Let's turn our attention to the <img> element again:</p>
            <code>< img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" ></code>
            <p>
                As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the alt text to them.</li>
                <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should see something like this in place of the image:
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

        <section class="main-section" id="Marking-up-Text">
          <header>Marking up Text</header>
          <article>
            <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
            <h3>Headings</h3>
            <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, < h1 >–< h6 >, although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
            <code>< h1 >My main title< /h1 >
                < h2 >My top level heading< /h2 >
                < h3 >My subheading< /h3 > 
                < h4 >My sub-subheading< /h4 ></code>
            <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
           <p> As explained above,  elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
             <code>< p >This is a single paragraph< /p ></code>
             <p>Add your sample text (you should have it from What will your website look like?) into one or a few paragraphs, placed directly below your < img > element.</p>
          </article>
          <h3>Lists</h3>
          A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
          <ol>
              <li><b>Unordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a < ul > element.</li>
              <li><b>Ordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an < ol > element.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an < li > (list item) element.</p>
          <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
          <code>< p >At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... < /p ></code>
          <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>
          <code>< p >At Mozilla, we’re a global community of< /p >

            < ul >
              < li >technologists< /li >
              < li >thinkers< /li >
              < li >builders< /li >
            < /ul >
            
            < p >working together ... < /p ></code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Links">
          <header>Links</header>
          <article>
            <p>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element — < a > — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a link, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
                <li>Wrap the text in an < a > element, as shown below</li>
                <code>< a >Mozilla Manifesto< /a ></code>
                <li>Give the < a > element an href attribute, as shown below:</li>
                <code> a href="" >Mozilla Manifesto< /a ></code>
                <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:</li>
                <code>< a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" >Mozilla Manifesto< /a ></code>
            </ol>
            <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the https:// or http:// part, called the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending you where you wanted it to.</p>
